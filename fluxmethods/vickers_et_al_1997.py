    Replace detected spikes with linear interpolation.

    This function replaces spike values in a time series with linearly interpolated
    values using valid neighboring points. It handles both isolated spikes and
    consecutive sequences of spikes, as well as error values in the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy.ndarray
        Input data array containing the original time series with spikes
    is_spike : numpy.ndarray
        Boolean array of same length as data, True where spikes were detected
    error_value : float
        Special value indicating invalid or missing data points
        These points are skipped when finding valid neighbors for interpolation

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Copy of input data with spikes replaced by linear interpolation

    Notes
    -----
    The interpolation strategy is:

    1. For each sequence of spikes, find valid (non-spike, non-error) points
       before and after the sequence
    2. If both points exist: perform linear interpolation
    3. If only one exists: use that value (nearest neighbor)
    4. If neither exists: spikes remain unchanged

    This implementation follows the EddyPro software's approach but is
    vectorized for better performance in Python.

    Detect and remove spikes in high-frequency eddy covariance data.

    This function implements the Vickers and Mahrt (1997) [1]_ despiking algorithm for
    eddy covariance data. It uses an iterative moving window approach to identify
    outliers based on local statistics. The algorithm can either flag spikes or
    both flag and remove them through linear interpolation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy.ndarray
        1D input data array containing high-frequency measurements
        (e.g., wind components, scalar concentrations)
    spike_mode : {1, 2}, optional
        Operation mode:
        - 1: Only detect spikes
        - 2: Detect and remove spikes via linear interpolation
        Default is 1
    max_pass : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations for spike detection.
        Each pass may use progressively larger thresholds.
        Default is 10
    avrg_len : int, optional
        Averaging period length in minutes.
        Used to determine the window size for local statistics.
        Default is 30
    ac_freq : int, optional
        Data acquisition frequency in Hz.
        Used to calculate the number of samples in each window.
        Default is 10
    spike_limit : float, optional
        Initial threshold for spike detection in standard deviations.
        Points exceeding mean ± (spike_limit × std) are flagged.
        Default is 3.5
    max_consec_spikes : int, optional
        Maximum number of consecutive points that can be flagged as spikes.
        Longer sequences are not considered spikes.
        Default is 3
    ctrplot : bool, optional
        If True, generates diagnostic plots showing:
        - Original data with detected spikes
        - Cleaned data with interpolated values
        Default is False

    Returns
    -------
    data_out : numpy.ndarray
        If spike_mode=1: Copy of input with spikes still present
        If spike_mode=2: Data with spikes replaced by linear interpolation
    is_spike : numpy.ndarray
        Boolean array same length as input, True where spikes were detected

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm follows these steps:

    1. Divides data into overlapping windows
    2. Calculates local mean and standard deviation
    3. Flags points exceeding threshold as potential spikes
    4. Checks for consecutive outliers
    5. Optionally interpolates across spike locations
    6. Repeats with adjusted threshold if spikes found

    The window advancement step is currently set to 100 samples, which
    differs from both the original VM97 paper (1 sample) and the EddyPro
    manual recommendation [2]_ (half window size).
